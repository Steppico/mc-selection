# MC SELECTION

## How does it work?

1. The software will select people whose checkbox is UNCHECKED.
2. Clicking the button "pick one!", a random person will be selected. That person will also be CHECKED, and it won't be selected next time.
3. Once everyone has been selected, by clicking "pick one!" again everyone will be deselected. By clicking it another time, someone will be selected.

### Other notes
1. The button "SELECT ALL" will, by no surprise, select everyone. Once clicked, it will change into "DESELECT ALL", and it will deselect everyone if clicked.
2. All data is stored in LocalStorage, so the page can be refreshed, the browser closed, and all data will still be available as is.
3. The checkboxes have been introduced to allow everyone to be the MC selector and quickly reproduce the current situation.
4. The background is a randomly generated color. If you like the tone, you can check it in the console :-)

### How about in the future?
Technically this software could be improved to allow:
- create teams based on projects;
- insert/delete members;
- move the project to Git so to have version control and accept contributions;
- inserting database support for more stable data managing;
- deploy the software somewhere and make it available through URL.

I might as well do so, as a side project. :) Will keep you up to date.
